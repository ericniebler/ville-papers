<h1 align=center>Disentangling schedulers and executors</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  This proposal proposes to simplify the design of schedulers and executors,
  providing a single conversion facility from an executor to a scheduler,
  removing the non-scheduler/sender/receiver facilities from
  schedule and connect, and keeping the ability to execute on either
  a scheduler or an executor.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
  Schedulers and executors are apples and oranges. Schedulers, senders,
  and receivers establish a generic protocol that is knit together
  so as to facilitate generic programming and algorithms that can
  operate within the framework of that protocol, transforming in various
  ways what senders and receivers do. Executors do not work with this
  protocol, because they do not provide two thirds of it; namely,
  they do not provide any means to ever invoke set_error or set_done.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore treating an executor as a scheduler is akin to a lossy
  conversion. The conversion is sufficiently lossy that it would be unwise
  if it Just Happens without any indication in source code. That's why
  multiple reviewers have suggested that that conversion should be
  explicit. This proposal makes it explicit.
</p>
<p>
  Once we accept that an executor shouldn't just be treated as a scheduler,
  we also realize that there's no point in providing support for plain
  invocable function objects for connecting them to senders directly.
  Such an operation is every bit as lossy as treating an executor as
  a scheduler. It should be likewise explicit, and there's no reason
  to provide it in the fundamental building blocks; a separate algorithm
  can be provided that connects a plain invocable to a sender.
</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<ol>
  <li><code>schedule()</code> operates on schedulers only.</li>
  <li><code>execute()</code> is a customization point that can operate on a scheduler
    or an executor. This is fine, since execute() is a fire-and-forget
    one-way call, and thus it's acceptable that it doesn't support
    the senders&amp;receivers protocol.</li>
  <li>All senders&amp;receivers-related operations, like <code>connect()</code>,
    operate on senders&amp;receivers only.</li>
  <li>There is a conversion function that takes anything
    that has a <code>.execute()</code> (including executors), and converts it
    to a scheduler. The working name for this function
    is <code>make_scheduler_from_executor()</code>, because that's what it does.
</ol>

<h2>Rumination</h2>

<h3>The current design is complex, confusing, and error-prone</h3>

<p>
  The current design allows execute() on anything, schedule() on anything,
  connect() on anything. But that makes no sense; execute() is okay
  as a one-way fire-and-forget mechanism, but schedule() on an executor
  tosses in the wind the <code>set_error/set_done</code> parts. Those
  parts are absolutely necessary for some senders&amp;receivers use
  cases to work. Padding them in with operations that e.g.
  <code>terminate</code> shouldn't just happen willy-nilly. Otherwise
  it becomes impossible to reason about generic code, and to trust
  that senders are actual senders, receivers are actual receivers,
  and that the senders&amp;receivers protocol actually works.
</p>

<p>
  This proposal makes the design clearer. In order to make the jump
  from executors (which don't conform to any protocol) to senders&amp;receivers,
  there is exactly one conversion operation that crosses that bridge
  (or rather jumps over the river when there is no bridge)
  Otherwise, the separate worlds are kept separate.
</p>
<p>
  Once in a senders&amp;receivers world, all operations related to them
  work as expected. The cross-river jump mentioned before is easy
  to find, and is greppable. One doesn't need to look at all operations,
  including <code>schedule</code> and <code>connect</code> and wonder
  whether they're operating on a scheduler and a sender or perhaps
  an executor and an invocable.
</p>
<p>
  It's still perfectly plausible to provide a function that queues
  a plain invocable to run as an error-ignoring receiver of a sender.
  But that's a separate named algorithm, not an overload of <code>connect</code>. It's still possible to indirectly call <code>schedule</code> on an executor,
  but that's <code>schedule(make_scheduler_from_executor(foo))</code>,
  not <code>schedule(foo)</code>.
</p>

<h3>The cross-concept bridging the current design attempts is not
  useful for programmers</h3>

<p>
  We are going to see a fair amount of generic algorithms that
  operate on senders. These algorithms will provide decorators
  that change (sometimes extend, sometimes transform) what
  senders, receivers, and operation_states do. They will be lego-like
  building blocks that introduce a particular form of aspect-oriented
  programming into the world of senders and receivers.
</p>
<p>
  Programmers, even library programmers, are expected to be mostly using
  such algorithms, rather than using things like <code>connect()</code>
  directly. These algorithms will be constrained to accept
  <code>schedulers, </code><code>senders</code>
  and <code>receivers</code>. They will not be constrained to accept
  both <code>schedulers</code> and <code>executors</code> even if the
  cross-concept bridging that's currently in P0443 might make using
  them on <code>executors</code> well-formed.
</p>
<p>
  We need a clear, simple, and understandable story of what our concepts
  are and what they do. That means we shouldn't encourage every programmer
  to deal with a <code>scheduler_or_executor</code> concept that's basically
  a disjunction of the two concepts. Executors aren't schedulers, so let's
  not pretend that they are. For those who insist on treating an executor
  as a scheduler, we provide them with a very explicit conversion function.
  Executors are a perfectly reasonable family of types in and of themselves,
  types that provide a less strict protocol than schedulers do; that's fine,
  those types can be used by audiences who have no use for the
  senders-and-receivers protocol. But as long as those audiences don't
  have a use for the senders-and-receivers protocol, we make the conversion
  from an executor to a scheduler _deliberately_ ugly.
</p>

<h2>Changes to P0443</h2>

<p>
  In 2.2.3.5 execution::connect, remove the third bullet:
</p>

<ul>
  <del><li>Otherwise, as-operation{s, r}, if
    <ul>
      <li>r is not an instance of as-receiver&lt;F, S'> for some type F where S and S' name the same type ignoring cv and reference qualifiers, and</li>

    <li>receiver_of&lt;R&gt; && executor-of-impl&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S&gt;, as-invocable&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;R&gt;, S&gt;&gt; is true,</li>
</ul>
<p>where as-operation is an implementation-defined class equivalent to</p>
<pre>
  struct as-operation {
    remove_cvref_t&lt;S&gt; e_;
    remove_cvref_t&lt;R&gt; r_;
    void start() noexcept try {
      execution::execute(std::move(e_), as-invocable&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;R&gt;, S&gt;{r_});
    } catch(...) {
      execution::set_error(std::move(r_), current_exception());
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>and as-invocable is a class template equivalent to the following:</p>

<pre>  template&lt;class R, class&gt;
  struct as-invocable {
    R* r_;
    explicit as-invocable(R& r) noexcept
      : r_(std::addressof(r)) {}
    as-invocable(as-invocable && other) noexcept
      : r_(std::exchange(other.r_, nullptr)) {}
    ~as-invocable() {
      if(r_)
        execution::set_done(std::move(*r_));
    }
    void operator()() & noexcept try {
      execution::set_value(std::move(*r_));
      r_ = nullptr;
    } catch(...) {
      execution::set_error(std::move(*r_), current_exception());
      r_ = nullptr;
    }
  };</pre></li></del>

<li>Otherwise, execution::connect(s, r) is ill-formed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In 2.2.3.8 execution::schedule, remove the third bullet:
</p>
<ul>
<del><li>Otherwise, as-sender&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S&gt;&gt;{s} if S satisfies executor, where as-sender is an implementation-defined class template equivalent to

<pre>  template&lt;class E&gt;
  struct as-sender {
  private:
    E ex_;
  public:
    template&lt;template&lt;class...&gt; class Tuple, template&lt;class...&gt; class Variant&gt;
      using value_types = Variant&lt;Tuple&lt;&gt;&gt;;
    template&lt;template&lt;class...&gt; class Variant&gt;
      using error_types = Variant&lt;std::exception_ptr&gt;;
    static constexpr bool sends_done = true;

    explicit as-sender(E e) noexcept
      : ex_((E&&) e) {}
    template&lt;class R&gt;
      requires receiver_of&lt;R&gt;
    connect_result_t&lt;E, R&gt; connect(R&& r) && {
      return execution::connect((E&&) ex_, (R&&) r);
    }
    template&lt;class R&gt;
      requires receiver_of&lt;R&gt;
    connect_result_t&lt;const E &, R&gt; connect(R&& r) const & {
      return execution::connect(ex_, (R&&) r);
    }
  };
</pre></li></del>
<li>Otherwise, execution::schedule(s) is ill-formed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  After 2.2.3, add a new section:
